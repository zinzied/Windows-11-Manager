This repository contains Python scripts to stop/disable and restore Windows 11 automatic updates.

## Introduction: Why Disable Windows Updates?

While Windows Updates are generally important for security and functionality, there are legitimate scenarios where users may need to temporarily or permanently disable automatic updates:

### üéØ **Common Reasons to Disable Updates:**

1. **System Stability Issues**
   - Problematic updates causing system crashes or boot failures
   - Driver conflicts introduced by recent updates
   - Software compatibility issues with critical applications

2. **Professional/Enterprise Environments**
   - Need for controlled update deployment schedules
   - Testing requirements before rolling out updates
   - Maintaining specific system configurations for production environments

3. **Limited Bandwidth/Data Constraints**
   - Metered internet connections with data caps
   - Slow internet connections where large updates disrupt work
   - Remote locations with unreliable internet access

4. **Gaming and Performance**
   - Preventing updates during critical gaming sessions or live streams
   - Avoiding performance impacts from background update processes
   - Maintaining optimal system performance for resource-intensive applications

5. **Legacy Software Dependencies**
   - Running older software that may break with newer Windows versions
   - Maintaining compatibility with specialized hardware or industrial equipment
   - Preserving specific system configurations required by legacy applications

6. **Development and Testing**
   - Creating stable development environments
   - Testing software on specific Windows versions
   - Preventing unexpected changes during development cycles

7. **System Control and Privacy**
   - Maintaining full control over what gets installed on the system
   - Avoiding unwanted feature changes or UI modifications
   - Preventing automatic installation of optional features or apps

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Important Considerations:**

**Security Trade-offs**: Disabling updates means missing important security patches. Consider:
- Only disable updates temporarily when necessary
- Manually install critical security updates when possible
- Re-enable updates periodically to stay protected
- Use additional security measures (antivirus, firewall) when updates are disabled

**Best Practices**:
- Create system restore points before disabling updates
- Keep the restore script readily available
- Monitor Microsoft security bulletins manually
- Consider selective update installation rather than complete disabling

## Files

- `disable_windows_updates.py` - Main script to disable Windows 11 updates
- `restore_windows_updates.py` - Script to restore Windows 11 updates functionality
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Features

### Disable Script (`disable_windows_updates.py`)
- **Stops Windows Update Services**: Stops and disables core update services
- **Registry Modifications**: Sets registry keys to prevent automatic updates
- **Disables Scheduled Tasks**: Disables Windows Update related scheduled tasks
- **Blocks Update URLs**: Adds Windows Update URLs to hosts file to block network access
- **Creates Restore Script**: Automatically generates the restore script

### Restore Script (`restore_windows_updates.py`)
- **Re-enables Services**: Restores Windows Update services to automatic startup
- **Cleans Registry**: Removes registry modifications that disable updates
- **Re-enables Tasks**: Restores Windows Update scheduled tasks
- **Unblocks URLs**: Removes Windows Update URL blocks from hosts file

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Administrator privileges (recommended for full functionality)

## Usage

### To Disable Windows Updates

1. **Run as Administrator** (recommended):
   ```cmd
   # Right-click Command Prompt -> "Run as administrator"
   python disable_windows_updates.py
   ```

2. **Or run normally** (some features may not work):
   ```cmd
   python disable_windows_updates.py
   ```

3. Follow the prompts and restart when asked for changes to take full effect.

### To Restore Windows Updates

1. **Run as Administrator**:
   ```cmd
   python restore_windows_updates.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts and restart when asked.

## What Each Script Does

### Disable Script Actions:
1. **Service Management**:
   - Stops: `wuauserv`, `bits`, `dosvc`, `UsoSvc`
   - Sets startup type to "Disabled"

2. **Registry Changes**:
   - Sets `NoAutoUpdate = 1`
   - Sets `AUOptions = 1` (notify before download)
   - Disables Windows Update access
   - Sets dummy update server URLs

3. **Scheduled Tasks**:
   - Disables Windows Update and Update Orchestrator tasks

4. **Network Blocking**:
   - Blocks Windows Update URLs in hosts file

### Restore Script Actions:
1. **Service Restoration**:
   - Re-enables all Windows Update services
   - Sets startup type to "Automatic"
   - Starts the services

2. **Registry Cleanup**:
   - Removes policy registry keys that disable updates

3. **Task Restoration**:
   - Re-enables all Windows Update scheduled tasks

4. **Network Restoration**:
   - Removes URL blocks from hosts file

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warnings**:
- These scripts modify system settings and should be used with caution
- Always run as Administrator for full functionality
- A system restart is recommended after running either script
- Keep the restore script safe in case you need to re-enable updates

üîí **Security Considerations**:
- Disabling Windows Updates can leave your system vulnerable to security threats
- Only disable updates temporarily and for specific reasons
- Consider re-enabling updates regularly to receive security patches

üìù **Compatibility**:
- Designed for Windows 11
- May work on Windows 10 with minor modifications
- Some features require Administrator privileges

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Access Denied" errors**:
   - Run the script as Administrator
   - Some operations require elevated privileges

2. **Service start/stop failures**:
   - Some services may be protected by Windows
   - Try running the script multiple times
   - Restart and try again

3. **Registry access errors**:
   - Ensure you're running as Administrator
   - Some registry keys may be protected

4. **Hosts file modification fails**:
   - Check if antivirus is blocking hosts file changes
   - Ensure Administrator privileges

### Manual Verification:

After running the disable script, you can verify:
- Services: `services.msc` ‚Üí Check Windows Update services are stopped/disabled
- Registry: `regedit` ‚Üí Navigate to Windows Update policy keys
- Tasks: `taskschd.msc` ‚Üí Check Windows Update tasks are disabled
- Hosts: Check `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` for blocked URLs
